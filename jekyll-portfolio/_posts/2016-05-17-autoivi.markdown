description: Automotive infotainment for a German auto manufacturer. This project lasted two weeks and was primarily designed for tradeshows displaying what the manufacturer is capable of. This was a solo project with limited input from my team. I was the primary designer responsible for creating an IA, deciding which pages to showcase in a visual design, and the visual design work.
